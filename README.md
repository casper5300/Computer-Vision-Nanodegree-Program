# Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Program
Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program 

Project 1:Facial Keypoint Detection
Project Overview
In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Project 2:Image Captioning
Project Overview
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.
After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!

Project 3: Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)
Project Overview
In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! You’ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
